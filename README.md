## Description

All-in-one solution for scheduling meals, calculating calorie intake, keeping track of the ingredients at disposal, calculating total amount of money spent on food.

How it is meant to be used:

1. When you buy groceries, you input them into the system. You can attach nutrition facts (ideally, this info can be read automatically from a photo) and price.
2. When you cook at home, you input all the products you used and the time at which you took your meal. Total calories in this meal and how much money the groceries in it cost will be calculated automatically.
3. If you ate out, you can input the price of the meal and approximate nutritional values.
4. When you drink water you can also input this into the system.
5. Various statistics (average calorie intake per day, whether you are overhydrated or dehydrated on average, how much you spend on food monthly) will be available. 
6. Possibly, advice on improving your diet will be provided.
